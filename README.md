## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze Citi Bike ride data in New York to discover user trends based on both customer gender and type (e.g. subcriber), and ride date, time, duration and location.

## Results
A majority of bikes are used in the early hours of the day, likely from commuters going to work:

A majority of Citi Bike customers are male:

Customers typically use the bikes between the hours of 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm. This is also likely from commuter use. On the weekends, however, the majority of bike use is between 10am and 6pm, likely from tourist use:

Displaying the trips by gender shows there is no significant difference between how the various genders use the bikes, as they are typically used beteen the hours of 7am and 9pm:

No matter the day of the week, a majority of trips are taken by male subscribers:

The highest volume of trips are taken in the downtown (lower half) of Manhattan, most likely due to commuter use:

The majority of customers (over 80%) are subscribers to Citi Bike. This shows the main business is generated from regular commuter (e.g. locals, working commuters) whereas less than 20% is made up from tourists or one-off customers:

## Summary
When looking at the results from New York's Citi Bike program, one can take away several useful tips for opening a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa:
1. Bike stations should have a larger amount of bikes available in high traffic areas/business locations. 
2. Bikes in the high traffic areas will likely need to be serviced more often, since their useage is much higher.
3. Since a majority of business is generated from subscribers, marketing efforts should be directed towards those who may use the service regularly.
4. Male customers should also be targeted since they make up the majority of subscribers.
